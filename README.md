# Barmada Lab Tools

This is a monorepo for curating any script or tool that might get used twice.

Generally, python projects will be developed using poetry, for which installation instructions can be found [[https://python-poetry.org/docs/][Here]] 

Each directory should have its own README with more specific info.
