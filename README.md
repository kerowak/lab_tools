# Barmada Lab Tools

This is a monorepo for curating any script or tool that might get used twice.

Generally, python projects will be developed using poetry, for which installation instructions can be found at https://python-poetry.org/docs/

Each directory should have its own README with more specific info.

# Easy update

run `./update.sh` from the base of lab_tools to pull new code & update dependencies
