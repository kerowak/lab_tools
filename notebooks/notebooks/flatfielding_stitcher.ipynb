    "# Flatfielding Stitcher\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're acquiring mosaics, you probably want to flatfield the images before you stitch them. Chances are, you probably don't care about the intermediate flatfielded & unstitched images. This utility will flatfield & stitch your images in one step without leaving all the intermediate gunk lying around!\n",
    "\n",
    "The flatfielder works by first identifying a group of images with a common background profile. The flatfielder forms a group by finding images with a common imaging channel & exposure length. It then randomly selects N images from that group and computes a median image. The median image is then subtracted from each member of the group. The resulting flatfielded images are fed onward into the stitcher, and the final outputs are written to the processed_imgs/stitched folder."

    "### python stitcher\n",
    "Run the following cell to use the python stitcher. This stitcher is more reliable in the sense that it will always output an image free of voids. Be aware, however, that the python stitcher does not compute overlap between adjacent tiles, so continuity cannot be guaranteed. This may have implications for morphological measurements taken across tile boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest source of misalignment in montages comes from camera rotation. You can check for this rotation by stitching with the imageJ stitcher using \"compute overlap.\" If the camera is rotated, the resulting mosaic will take on a skewed rhombus shape with sawtooth edges. If you are certain that the camera has no rotation relative to the stage's coordinate system, or aren't concerned about discontinuities across tile boundaries, then the python stitcher should work fine."
